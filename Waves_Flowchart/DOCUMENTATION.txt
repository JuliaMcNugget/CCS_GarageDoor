FINAL PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

STEPPER MOTOR INFORMATION:
THE STEPPER MOTOR B HAS A TOTAL OF 2052 STEPS PER ROTATION, MEANING THAT FOR IT TO ROTATE IN 15 SECONDS, IT WOULD NEED TO HAVE 136.8 PULSES  PER SECOND. CONSIDERING THIS, WE ARE USING A SMCLCK (1MHz) WITH A DIVIDER OF 15 WHICH MAKES AN OVERFLOW AT A RATE OF APPROX 17,857 Hz. IF WE WANT TO HAVE THE 137 PULSES PER SECOND, TIMES 2 BECAUSE OF THE WAVE WE'RE USING, WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE AN OVERFLOW EVERY 68.5 Hz. WE'LL BE MOVING AT A RATE OF ABOUT 4 RPM.
CONSIDERING THAT 131 Hz WILL BE THE RATE, TO FIND THE AMOUNT OF STEPS TO TAKE PER SECOND WILL BE EQUAL TO THE 4 STEPS IT TAKES TO MAKE A FULL REVOLUTION, TIMES THE 4 EXTRA INBETWEEN STEPS WE HAVE, TIMES THE 32 TIMES IT CYCLES THROUGH TO ROTATE THE 1/32 STEPPER AROUND ONCE, TIMES THE 64 TIMES IT NEEDS TO FULLY ROTATE = 4096 TIMES IT NEEDS ITERATE THROUGH THE FULL INDUCTOR CYCLE.

TO CLOSE THE GATE HAVING  AMAXIMUM RPM OF 6, WE COULD GO UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 1 STEP PER 87Hz.SO WE'LL GO FOR A STEP EVERY 90 Hz. USING THE SAME CYCLES AS OPENING THE GATE.

PRESSURE PLATE INFORMATION:
FOR THE PRESSURE PLATE, ESTIMATING 1 KG TO BE 1.5mV WE WOULD NEED A READING OF 2.4 VOLTS TO READ IN A CAR THAT WEIGHS 1600KG. TO ACHIEVE THIS WE WILL FIND THE PRESIONS USING THE FORMULA GIVEN IN THE BOOK:
						3.3V
PRECISION=----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					2^12 (BIT RESOLUTION)
	
	    = 0.00068359375 V PER BIN
AND THE BIT CONVERSION NEEDED WOULD BE EQUAL TO:
(2^12/3.3)2.4 = 2979 BITS. 

HOWEVER THE READING WAS SLIGHTLY OFF ON MY DEVICE AND I ADJUSTED IT TO BE SET TO 3005 FOR A CLOSER READING AT 2.412V.
